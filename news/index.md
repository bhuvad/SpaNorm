# Changelog

## SpaNorm 1.2.0

- Added model-based spatially variable gene (SVG) calling.
- Added spatial visualisation funciton `plotSpatial` to visualise
  colData, gene expression, and reduced dimensions.
- Added spatial visualisation function `plotCovariate` to visualise the
  biolgy, batch, and library size functions estimated by SpaNorm.
- Dynamic calculation of df.tps for rectangular tissue sections.
- Allow separate specification of df.tps for biology and library size.
- Added GLM-PCA approximation through the `SpaNormPCA` function. The
  null model is considered to consist of the library size effects, batch
  effects, and the gene mean.

## SpaNorm 1.0.0

- Initial Bioconductor submission.
