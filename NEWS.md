# SpaNorm 1.2.0

* Added model-based spatially variable gene (SVG) calling.
* Added spatial visualisation funciton `plotSpatial` to visualise colData, gene expression, and reduced dimensions.
* Added spatial visualisation function `plotCovariate` to visualise the biolgy, batch, and library size functions estimated by SpaNorm.
* Dynamic calculation of df.tps for rectangular tissue sections.
* Allow separate specification of df.tps for biology and library size.
* Added GLM-PCA approximation through the `SpaNormPCA` function. The null model is considered to consist of the library size effects, batch effects, and the gene mean.

# SpaNorm 1.0.0

* Initial Bioconductor submission.
